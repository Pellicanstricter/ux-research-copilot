User: Well, I've been using it for about 3 months now. Overall it's pretty good, but I have to say the navigation is sometimes confusing. Like, when I'm trying to find my order history, I expect it to be under "My Account" but it's actually under "Orders" which is separate.

Interviewer: That's interesting. Can you walk me through what you typically do when you open the app?

User: Sure. So I usually open it to check if my delivery is on time. But the tracking feature is buried - I have to go through like 3 different screens to find it. It should be right on the main page when I have an active order.

Interviewer: What would make the app more useful for you?

User: Honestly, just make things easier to find. And maybe send me notifications when my order status changes instead of me having to check manually all the time. I'm always worried I'll miss the delivery.

Interviewer: Any other feedback?

User: The app crashes sometimes when I'm trying to pay. It's really frustrating when you're in a hurry. And the search function doesn't work very well - I can never find what I'm looking for.

Participant: I use a mix of apps, honestly. I have one for counting steps, another for workouts, and I write down my weight in a notebook. It's kind of a mess.

Interviewer: What frustrates you most about this process?

Participant: Having to switch between different apps all the time. And nothing talks to each other, so I can't see the big picture. Like, did my workout yesterday actually help me reach my weekly goal? I have no idea because the data is scattered everywhere.

Interviewer: If you could have one solution, what would it look like?

Participant: Something that just works together. All my fitness data in one place, and maybe it could tell me if I'm on track to meet my goals without me having to do math in my head. Simple charts or something visual would be great.

Participant: Also, I want to see my progress over time. Like, am I actually getting fitter? The current apps just show me today's data, but I want to see trends.

Interviewer: What about social features?

Participant: That would be nice! Maybe I could share my achievements with friends or join challenges. That would motivate me to keep going.
